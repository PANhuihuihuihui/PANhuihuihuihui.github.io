      institution: The University of Hong Kong
      year: 06/2021 - 09/2021
      description:
        - Successfully self-implemented a server response to the HTTP request, WebSocket link was established, and more than 10 real-time video streams were transmitted in the local network.
        - Implemented GMM model to make the heat detection have better adaptive and anti-jamming ability.
        - Optimized C++ code in the Qt framework (5% fps increased) and deployed in Raspberry Pi

      year: 06/2020 - 09/2020
      description:
        - Communicated with the Party A to clarify their needs and narrowed down the gap with practice.
        - title: Model development and design
          contents:
            - Used the ResNet to get key points of worker, Fast R-CNN to detect the Helmet. Adopt the FPN improve the performance on Helmets size variation caused by distance.
            - Utilized SORT to tracking multiple worker and stack counter stabilize the output.
            - Added face detection to reduce the false alarm rate helmets may be occluded by their body some because of squatting to work.
        - title: Achievement
          contents:
            - Capture a worker â€™s image after detecting he is not wearing helmet for 2 seconds,
sending it to cloud sever and trigger an IOT LED alarm on site.
            - The detection accuracy was above 95%. The false detection rate was below 1%.
